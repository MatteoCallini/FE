Basel banking regulation requires banks to maintain a minimum capital requirement to guard against potential future unexpected losses.
Two are the essential parameters in Internal Rating Based (IRB) approaches for credit capital requirements: the Probability of Default (PD) 
and the Loss-Given-Default (LGD). This project assesses the impact on regulatory capital of the uncertainty of each parameter separately
We’ve compared an IRB simplified calibration approach that considers only average PD and LGD, to an approach that -including the whole information
on the complete distribution of PD and LGD obtained from Moody’s data and not only the mean- leads to a significant Add-On on capital requirements.
Results are striking.
